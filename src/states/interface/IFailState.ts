 * A Fail state ("Type": "Fail") stops the execution of the state machine and marks it as a failure.
 *
 * The Fail state only allows the use of Type and Comment fields from the set of common state
 * fields. Because Fail states always exit the state machine, they have no Next field nor do they
 * require an End field.
